# Course Review System

Welcome to the **Course Review System**! This project is a full-stack application that allows users to review and interact with courses listed by others. Users can log in, add courses, and share their experiences through reviews. It also provides functionality for users to manage their reviews and explore reviews of courses they've added.

This system provides a hands-on experience in building a modern web application, integrating user authentication, managing CRUD operations, handling reviews, and ensuring secure database interactions.
